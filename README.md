## What this is

An architectural proposal for a new role within Mixture-of-Experts layers. Some expert slots are designated not as inference computations but as **parameter updater experts** whose output is a weight delta ($\Delta w$) applied to sibling inference experts. Under this concept the MoE router's sparse gating mechanism implicitly determines both what to compute *and* when and whether the model adapts its own parameters.

The preprint also presents **DeltaNet-LoRA**, a mechanism-isolation prototype that validates a necessary submechanism of the full framework — learned, persistent weight-delta generation — on a real pretrained MoE (OLMoE-1B-7B). DeltaNet-LoRA is a constrained retrofit experiment, not a full instantiation of the framework; router-selected updater activation, expert-indexed peer modification, and multi-updater interactions remain future work.

## Highlights from the preprint

- Four-fold novelty mapping against prior art at the intersection of HyperNetworks, Fast Weight Programmers, and Mixture of Experts (§2).
- Framework definition with expert role taxonomy, $\Delta w$ parameterization design space, router semantics, multi-updater extensions, and persistent state (§3).
- On OLMoE-1B-7B with all base weights frozen, DeltaNet-LoRA reaches 80.1% persistent fact retrieval under a sliding-window attention constraint (mechanism validation), 52.2% under full causal attention via a dual-updater variant, and 54.0% on natural-language templated facts with a single persistent updater drawing from per-layer hidden states (§5).
- Ablations showing simple gated linear interpolation beats surprise-gating and delta-rule variants at low rank on a single-researcher compute budget.
- A parallel-scan reformulation yielding 2.77× training speedup with comparable accuracy.
